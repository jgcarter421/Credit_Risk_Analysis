# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use several different machine learning algorithms to predict the credit risk of of loan applicants utilizing Lending Club's credit card credit dataset.  This will assist in enabling Fast Lending to determine who to issue a loan to, and who is a bad credit risk.  

To do this, I used the following data analysis techniques:
* Oversampling 
* Undersampling
* Comination (Over and Under) Sampling
* Ensemble Learners

To determine the best machine learning model to use, I assessed the Balanced Accuracy Score, as well as the Precision and Recall Scores.
